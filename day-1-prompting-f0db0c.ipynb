    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

      "\n",
      "He tiptoed through the garden, his senses on high alert. A fat robin hopped across the lawn, its red breast a beacon in the green. Bartholomew, emboldened by his newfound freedom, stalked it with a silent grace. \n",

      "The adventure led him deeper into the woods, the path narrowing under the dense canopy of leaves.  He encountered a family of squirrels, their bushy tails twitching, and a curious rabbit with a nose that twitched nervously. Each encounter fuelled his sense of wonder. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the world shifted.  The sun dipped low, casting long, eerie shadows. The familiar smells of home faded, replaced by the earthy scent of damp leaves and a haunting, unfamiliar scent. Fear prickled Bartholomew's fur. He was lost.\n",

      "A low growl emanated from the darkness ahead. Bartholomew, his bravery momentarily forgotten, froze.  A pair of eyes, glowing like embers, peered back at him.  The growl deepened, followed by a low, guttural purr. A majestic tabby, larger and more imposing than Bartholomew, stepped out from the shadows.\n",

Bartholomew walked back to his cozy cottage, a newfound wisdom in his eyes. He knew he would never be the same. The world, he realised, was a tapestry of wonders waiting to be explored. And he, Bartholomew the tabby, was no longer content with mere dust bunnies.  He was ready for more adventures. \n",

       "   - This makes it easier to see where you are in your Git workflow without having to type `git status` every time.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Loads themes:**\n",
       "   - It allows you to choose different themes (color schemes) for your prompt, including a custom theme that you can create.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Fetches remote status:**\n",
       "   - It can automatically fetch changes from your remote repository, keeping your prompt up-to-date. \n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Provides information about the current repository:**\n",
       "   - It displays information like the current branch, whether you are ahead or behind the remote branch, and the number of changed, staged, and untracked files. \n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Integrates with virtual environments:**\n",
       "   - It can display the name of your current virtual environment (if you're using one) in your prompt.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Sets window title:**\n",
       "   - It can dynamically set your window title based on the information in your prompt.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Supports various configurations:**\n",
       "   - It allows you to configure various aspects of your prompt, such as how the information is displayed, whether to show untracked files, and the frequency of remote status updates.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why would you use it?**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Better visibility:** You can quickly see your Git status without running commands.\n",
       "- **Enhanced productivity:** It saves time and simplifies your workflow.\n",
       "- **Improved readability:** Colored output makes your prompt easier to understand.\n",
       "- **Customization:** You can tailor your prompt to your preferences.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How to use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Save the script:** Download the script and save it to your system.\n",
       "2. **Source the script:** In your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file, add the line: \n",
